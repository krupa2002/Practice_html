    <p> London (/ˈlʌndən/ LUN-dən)[6] is the capital and largest city of both England and the United Kingdom, with a population of around 8.8 million.[7] The wider metropolitan area is the largest in Western Europe, with a population of 14.9 million.[8][c] London stands on the River Thames in southeast England, at the head of a 50-mile (80 km) estuary down to the North Sea, and has been a major settlement for nearly 2,000 years.[9] Its ancient core and financial centre, the City of London, was founded by the Romans as Londinium and has retained its medieval boundaries.[d][10] The City of Westminster, to the west of the City of London, has been the centuries-long host of the national government and parliament. London grew rapidly in the 19th century, becoming the world's largest city at the time as it expanded and absorbed the surrounding county of Middlesex alongside parts of Surrey and Kent. In 1965, it was combined with parts of Essex and Hertfordshire[11] to create the administrative area of Greater London,[11] which is governed by 33 local authorities and the Greater London Authority.[e][12]</p>
